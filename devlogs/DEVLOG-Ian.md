### 05/20/25 - Learning Sha256
Did research on how SHA256 works and the steps it takes to hash something with this algorithm.

### 05/22/25 - Constants and README
Added constants required for the SHA256 hashing algorithm.
These constants represent the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes
and the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes.

Updated and formatted README

### 05/23/25 - Test cases and simplification
Added test cases
More abstraction
Simplified preprocessing step

### 05/24/25 - Fix preprocessing, add test cases for preprocessing
As the name implies...
